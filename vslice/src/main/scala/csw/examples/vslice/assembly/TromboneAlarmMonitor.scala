/**
 * Actor manages Trombone alarms and provides the assembly interface to the TMT Alarm Service.
 *
 * Trombone has two alarms tied to reaching encoder limits, which would indicate abnormal behavior requiring an operator's attention.
 * The two alarms are highLimitAlarm and lowLimitAlarm indicating the axis has reached the high user limit and low user limit respectively.
 *
 * The monitor subscribes to CurrentState events from the HCD, which can be provided directly as a connection to the HCD or through a
 * CurrentStateReceiver actor, which uses the same message for subscribing.
 *
 * The AlarmMonitor has two states, one for normal operation with no alarms and one for when trombone is in an alarm state. This is possible
 * because the axis can't be in the high and low alarm state simultaneously. While in the normal state, the monitor looks for high or low
 * limits set in the CurrentState data from the HCD.  When in the alarm state, it looks for the alarm to return to the normal state so that
 * the alarm can be cleared. A CSW client must not only set its alarms when they go to an alarm state, but also clear them when the
 * conditions causing the alarm are removed.
 *
 * When the alarm starts up, it writes okay to the Alarm Service so that the Alarm Service client will begin to maintain the current
 * values for the Alarm Service, which requires that the Assembly update its alarms periodically. This is handled by the Alarm Service
 * client, and will cause the alarms to go to disconnected, if the assembly quits.
 *
 * @param currentStateReceiver the currentStateReceiver that delivers CurrentState messages either through an HCD or a CurrentStateReceiver.
 * @param alarmService reference to the alarm service used
