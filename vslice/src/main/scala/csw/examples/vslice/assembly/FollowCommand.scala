/**
 * FollowCommand encapsulates the actors that collaborate to implement the Follow command.
 *
 * A FollowCommand actor is created as a side effect when the trombone assembly receives the Follow command. This actor is created
 * and exists after the Follow command and until the Stop command is received.
 *
 * Follow command creates a TromboneControl actor which receives stage position updates.
 * It creates a TromboneEventSubscriber, which subscribes to the zenith angle system events from the TCS, and the focus error system
 * events from the RTC. The TromboneEventSubscriber forwards these updates to the follow actor, which processes them and computes new
 * trombone stage positions as well as other events.
 *
 * The publisher of events is injected into the FollowCommand and injected into the FollowActor. This is done because the publisher is
 * shared in the Assembly by other actors.
 *
 * The follow command acts differently depending on the value of nssInUseIn, which is true of the NFIRAOS Source Simulator is in use or not.
 * See specs, but when in use, the Follow Actor ignores zenith angle updates. When nssInUse is true, the TromboneEventSubscriber always sends
 * the value of 0.0 for the zenith angle no matter what.
 *
 * nssInUse can be updated while operational. This is only used for testing to ensure that the zero angle behavior is working (see tests).
 * During operation, a new FollowCommand is created when the use of the NSS changes. If following, a Stop must be issued, and a new Follow
 * command with nssInUse set accordingly.
 *
 * Note that the actor receive method is parameterized with an optional HCD actor ref. The HCD actor is set initially when
 * the actor is created and may be updated if the actor goes down or up. The actor ref is an [[scala.Option]] so
 * that if the actor ref is set to None, no message will be sent, but the actor can operator normally. FollowCommand forwards this update
 * to the TromboneControl
 *
 * When the FollowCommand actor is killed, all its created actors are killed. The subscriptions to the event service and telemetry service
 * are removed.
 *
 * While "following" the trombone assembly can accept the SetAngle and SetElevation commands, which are forwarded to the Follow actor
 * that executes the algorithms for the trombone assembly.
 *
 * @param ac the trombone Assembly context contains shared values and functions
 * @param nssInUseIn a BooleanParameter, set to true if the NFIRAOS Source Simulator is in use, set to false if not in use
 * @param tromboneHCDIn the actor reference to the trombone HCD as a [[scala.Option]]
 * @param eventPublisher the actor reference to the shared TrombonePublisher actor as a [[scala.Option]]
 * @param eventService EventService for subscriptions
 *
